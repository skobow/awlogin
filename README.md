## awlogin
Command line utility to facilitate AWS Secure CLI MFA Logons. 

Running `awlogin -h` show the following additional info:

This utility facilitates secured CLI MFA authentication to any AWS account profile defined in `~/.aws/credentials`. The utility expects that file to be formatted in the following sample manner:

<pre><code>
[default]
profile_name = stag
aws_access_key_id = AKERNEIDUFENICUQ3NDO
aws_secret_access_key = ilsjkasdUEwlwDUgvD1b7234Fn/lepi0ACmk8upFy

[prod]
profile_name = prod
account_number = 544492114123
user_role = PowerUser

[accountN]
profile_name = accountN
account_number = 512345114123
user_role = Administrator
</code></pre>

In other words ...
  1. The **default** profile is for your main AWS account, where your users are stored
 Â 2. All other profiles are treated as **federated** AWS accounts that you may have access to
  3. You **must** defined a valid key pair for your **default** profile
  4. Each profile must have a unique profile_name so this utility can identify it
  5. Each federated profile must have a valid **account_number** and **user_role**
  6. The `-c` switch can create a fresh skeleton `~/.aws/credentials` file

## Installation
  1. `git clone git@github.com:lencap/awlogin`
  2. `cd awlogin`
  3. `pip install .` Note the period (`.`) at the end.
  4. To reinstall after a recent code update do: `pip install --upgrade --no-deps --force-reinstall .`
